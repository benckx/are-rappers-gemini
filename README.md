# About

I was arguing with somebody about the legitimacy of astrology. After some back-and-forth, the person stated that since
"most rappers were Gemini", that would indicate some level of correlation between astrological sign and areas of
interest.

Since it was a falsifiable statement, this kindled my curiosity, and I took a couple of hours to write a small script
that would fetch all rappers on Wikipedia along their date of birth. Quite unsurprisingly, one would find no remarkable
correlation between the musical genre and Gemini.

This may all seems a little bit odd and out of place, but I would argue it is important to develop the tools of critical
thinking and debunk quackery everywhere it's found.
