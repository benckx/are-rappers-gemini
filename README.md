# About

I was arguing with somebody about the legitimacy of astrology. After some back-and-forth, the person stated that since
"most rappers were Gemini", that would indicate some level of correlation between astrological sign and areas of
interest.

Since it was a falsifiable statement, this kindled my curiosity, and I took a couple of hours to write a small script
that would fetch all rappers from Wikipedia (about 600) along their date of birth. Quite unsurprisingly, one would find
no remarkable correlation between the musical genre and Gemini.

This may all seems a little bit odd and out of place, but I would argue it is important to develop the tools of critical
thinking and debunk quackery everywhere it's found.

## Results

```
Aries -> 0.0688
Taurus -> 0.0832
Gemini -> 0.0864
Cancer -> 0.0928
Leo -> 0.1024
Virgo -> 0.0896
Libra -> 0.0848
Scorpio -> 0.0912
Sagittarius -> 0.0784
Capricorn -> 0.0864
Aquarius -> 0.0528
Pisces -> 0.0832
```

As expected, about 1/12th (+/- 8.3%) of rappers are Gemini.
